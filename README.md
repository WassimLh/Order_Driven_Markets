# Order_Driven_Markets
This project studies Order-driven markets, by using three different econophysics models:

- The order book as a reaction-diffusion model (BPS, 1987)
- Model introducing limit and market orders (Maslov, 2000)
- The order book as a deposition-evaporation model (Mike & Farmer,2008)
